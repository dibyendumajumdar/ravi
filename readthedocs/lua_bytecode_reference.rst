Lua Stack and Registers
=======================
Lua employs two stacks.
The ``Callinfo`` stack tracks activation frames. 
There is the secondary stack ``L->stack`` that is an array of ``TValue`` objects. 
The ``Callinfo`` objects index into this array. Registers are basically slots in 
the ``L->stack`` array.

When a function is called - the stack is setup as follows::

  stack
  |            function reference
  |            var arg 1
  |            ... 
  |            var arg n
  | base->     fixed arg 1
  |            ...
  |            fixed arg n
  |            local 1
  |            ...
  |            local n
  |            temporaries 
  |            ...
  |  top->     
  |  
  V

So ``top`` is just past the registers needed by the function. 
The number of registers is determined based on parameters, locals and temporaries.

For each Lua function, the ``base`` of the stack is set to the first fixed parameter or local.
All register addressing is done as offset from ``base`` - so ``R(0)`` is at ``base+0`` on the stack.

   The figure above shows how the stack is related to other Lua objects.

'``OP_CALL``' instruction
=========================

Syntax
------

::

  CALL A B C    R(A), ... ,R(A+C-2) := R(A)(R(A+1), ... ,R(A+B-1))

Description
-----------

Performs a function call, with register R(A) holding the reference to the function object to be called. Parameters to the function are placed in the registers following R(A). If B is 1, the function has no parameters. If B is 2 or more, there are (B-1) parameters. If B >= 2, then upon entry to the called function, R(A+1) will become the ``base``. 

If B is 0, the function parameters range from R(A+1) to the top of the stack. This form is used when the 
number of parameters to pass is set by the previous VM instruction, which has to be one of '``OP_CALL``' or
'``OP_VARARG``'. 

Examples
--------

Example of '``OP_VARARG``' followed by '``OP_CALL``'::

  function y(...) print(...) end

  1 [1] GETTABUP  0 0 -1  ; _ENV "print"
  2 [1] VARARG    1 0     ; VARARG will set L->top
  3 [1] CALL      0 0 1   ; B=0 so L->top set by previous instruction
  4 [1] RETURN    0 1

Example of '``OP_CALL``' followed by '``OP_CALL``'::

  function z1() y(x()) end

  1 [1] GETTABUP  0 0 -1  ; _ENV "y"
  2 [1] GETTABUP  1 0 -2  ; _ENV "x"
  3 [1] CALL      1 1 0   ; C=0 so return values indicated by L->top
  4 [1] CALL      0 0 1   ; B=0 so L->top set by previous instruction
  5 [1] RETURN    0 1

Thus upon entry to a function ``base`` is always the location of the first fixed parameter if any or else ``local`` if any. The three possibilities are shown below.

::

                                       Two variable args and 1     Two variable args and no 
  Caller   One fixed arg               fixed arg                   fixed args
  R(A)     CI->func  [ function    ]   CI->func  [ function    ]   CI->func [ function   ]
  R(A+1)   CI->base  [ fixed arg 1 ]             [ var arg 1   ]            [ var arg 1  ]
  R(A+2)             [ local 1     ]             [ var arg 2   ]            [ var arg 2  ]
  R(A+3)                               CI->base  [ fixed arg 1 ]   CI->base [ local 1    ]
  R(A+4)                                         [ local 1     ]
                                        
Results returned by the function call are placed in a range of registers starting from R(A). If C is 1, no return results are saved. If C is 2 or more, (C-1) return values are saved. If C is 0, then multiple return results are saved. In this case the number of values to save is determined by one of following ways:

* A C function returns an integer value indicating number of results returned so for C function calls
  this is used (see the value of ``n`` passed to `luaD_poscall() <http://www.lua.org/source/5.3/ldo.c.html#luaD_poscall>`_ in `luaD_precall() <http://www.lua.org/source/5.3/ldo.c.html#luaD_precall>`_)
* For Lua functions, the the results are saved by the called function's '``OP_RETURN``' instruction.

More examples
-------------

::

  x=function() y() end

  function <stdin:1,1> (3 instructions at 000000CECB2BE040)
  0 params, 2 slots, 1 upvalue, 0 locals, 1 constant, 0 functions
    1       [1]     GETTABUP        0 0 -1  ; _ENV "y"
    2       [1]     CALL            0 1 1
    3       [1]     RETURN          0 1
  constants (1) for 000000CECB2BE040:
    1       "y"
  locals (0) for 000000CECB2BE040:
  upvalues (1) for 000000CECB2BE040:
    0       _ENV    0       0

In line [2], the call has zero parameters (field B is 1), zero results are retained (field C is 1), while register A temporarily holds the reference to the function object from global y. Next we see a function call with multiple parameters or arguments::

  x=function() z(1,2,3) end

  function <stdin:1,1> (6 instructions at 000000CECB2D7BC0)
  0 params, 4 slots, 1 upvalue, 0 locals, 4 constants, 0 functions
    1       [1]     GETTABUP        0 0 -1  ; _ENV "z"
    2       [1]     LOADK           1 -2    ; 1
    3       [1]     LOADK           2 -3    ; 2
    4       [1]     LOADK           3 -4    ; 3
    5       [1]     CALL            0 4 1
    6       [1]     RETURN          0 1
  constants (4) for 000000CECB2D7BC0:
    1       "z"
    2       1
    3       2
    4       3
  locals (0) for 000000CECB2D7BC0:
  upvalues (1) for 000000CECB2D7BC0:
    0       _ENV    0       0


Lines [1] to [4] loads the function reference and the arguments in order, then line [5] makes the call with an operand B value of 4, which means there are 3 parameters. Since the call statement is not assigned to anything, no return results need to be retained, hence field C is 1. Here is an example that uses multiple parameters and multiple return values::


  x=function() local p,q,r,s = z(y()) end

  function <stdin:1,1> (5 instructions at 000000CECB2D6CC0)
  0 params, 4 slots, 1 upvalue, 4 locals, 2 constants, 0 functions
    1       [1]     GETTABUP        0 0 -1  ; _ENV "z"
    2       [1]     GETTABUP        1 0 -2  ; _ENV "y"
    3       [1]     CALL            1 1 0
    4       [1]     CALL            0 0 5
    5       [1]     RETURN          0 1
  constants (2) for 000000CECB2D6CC0:
    1       "z"
    2       "y"
  locals (4) for 000000CECB2D6CC0:
    0       p       5       6
    1       q       5       6
    2       r       5       6
    3       s       5       6
  upvalues (1) for 000000CECB2D6CC0:
    0       _ENV    0       0

First, the function references are retrieved (lines [1] and [2]), then function y is called first (temporary register 1). The CALL
has a field C of 0, meaning multiple return values are accepted. These return values become the parameters to function z, and so in line [4], field B of the CALL instruction is 0, signifying multiple parameters. After the call to function z, 4 results are retained, so field C in line [4] is 5. Finally, here is an example with calls to standard library functions::

  x=function() print(string.char(64)) end

  function <stdin:1,1> (7 instructions at 000000CECB2D6220)
  0 params, 3 slots, 1 upvalue, 0 locals, 4 constants, 0 functions
    1       [1]     GETTABUP        0 0 -1  ; _ENV "print"
    2       [1]     GETTABUP        1 0 -2  ; _ENV "string"
    3       [1]     GETTABLE        1 1 -3  ; "char"
    4       [1]     LOADK           2 -4    ; 64
    5       [1]     CALL            1 2 0
    6       [1]     CALL            0 0 1
    7       [1]     RETURN          0 1
  constants (4) for 000000CECB2D6220:
    1       "print"
    2       "string"
    3       "char"
    4       64
  locals (0) for 000000CECB2D6220:
  upvalues (1) for 000000CECB2D6220:
    0       _ENV    0       0

When a function call is the last parameter to another function call, the former can pass multiple return values, while the latter can accept multiple parameters.

'``OP_TAILCALL``' instruction
=============================

Syntax
------

::

  TAILCALL  A B C return R(A)(R(A+1), ... ,R(A+B-1))

Description
-----------

Performs a tail call, which happens when a return statement has a single function call as the expression, e.g. return foo(bar). A tail call results in the function being interpreted within the same call frame as the caller - the stack is replaced and then a 'goto' executed to start at the entry point in the VM. Only Lua functions can be tailcalled. Tailcalls allow infinite recursion without growing the stack.

Like '``OP_CALL``', register R(A) holds the reference to the function object to be called. B encodes the number of parameters in the same manner as a '``OP_CALL``' instruction.

C isn’t used by TAILCALL, since all return results are significant. In any case, Lua always generates a 0 for C, to denote multiple return results.

Examples
--------
An '``OP_TAILCALL``' is used only for one specific return style, described above. Multiple return results are always produced by a tail call. Here is an example:


::

  > function y() return x('foo', 'bar') end
  > ravi.dumplua(y)

  function <stdin:1,1> (6 instructions at 000000C3C24DE4A0)
  0 params, 3 slots, 1 upvalue, 0 locals, 3 constants, 0 functions
    1       [1]     GETTABUP        0 0 -1  ; _ENV "x"
    2       [1]     LOADK           1 -2    ; "foo"
    3       [1]     LOADK           2 -3    ; "bar"
    4       [1]     TAILCALL        0 3 0
    5       [1]     RETURN          0 0
    6       [1]     RETURN          0 1
  constants (3) for 000000C3C24DE4A0:
    1       "x"
    2       "foo"
    3       "bar"
  locals (0) for 000000C3C24DE4A0:
  upvalues (1) for 000000C3C24DE4A0:
    0       _ENV    0       0


Arguments for a tail call are handled in exactly the same way as arguments for a normal call, so in line [4], the tail call has a field B value of 3, signifying 2 parameters. Field C is 0, for multiple returns; this due to the constant LUA_MULTRET in lua.h. In practice, field C is not used by the virtual machine (except as an assert) since the syntax guarantees multiple return results.
Line [5] is a '``OP_RETURN``' instruction specifying multiple return results. This is required when the function called by '``OP_TAILCALL`` is a C function. In the case of a C function, execution continues to line [5] upon return, thus the RETURN is necessary. Line [6] is redundant. When Lua functions are tailcalled, the virtual machine does not return to line [5] at all.

'``OP_RETURN``' instruction
===========================

Syntax
------

::

  RETURN  A B return R(A), ... ,R(A+B-2)

Description
-----------

Returns to the calling function, with optional return values. 

First '``OP_RETURN``'' closes any open upvalues by calling `luaF_close() <http://www.lua.org/source/5.3/lfunc.c.html#luaF_close>`_.

If B is 1, there are no return values. If B is 2 or more, there are (B-1) return values, located in consecutive registers from R(A) onwards. If B is 0, the set of values range from R(A) to the top of the stack. 

It is assumed that if the VM is returning to a Lua function then it is within the same invocation of the ``luaV_execute()``. Else it is assumed that ``luaV_execute()`` is being invoked from a C function.

If B is 0 then the previous instruction (which must be either '``OP_CALL``' or '``OP_VARARG``' ) would have set ``L->top`` to indicate how many values to return. The number of values to be returned in this case is R(A) to L->top. 

If B > 0 then the number of values to be returned is simply B-1.

'``OP_RETURN``' calls `luaD_poscall() <http://www.lua.org/source/5.3/ldo.c.html#luaD_poscall>`_ which is responsible for copying return values to the caller - the first result is placed at the current ``closure``'s address. ``luaD_poscall()`` leaves ``L->top`` just past the last result that was copied.

If '``OP_RETURN``' is returning to a Lua function and if the number of return values expected was indeterminate - i.e. '``OP_CALL``' had operand C = 0, then ``L->top`` is left where ``luaD_poscall()`` placed it - just beyond the top of the result list. This allows the '``OP_CALL``' instruction to figure out how many results were returned. If however '``OP_CALL``' had invoked with a value of C > 0 then the expected number of results is known, and in that case, ``L->top`` is reset to  the calling function's ``C->top``.

If ``luaV_execute()`` was called externally then '``OP_RETURN``' leaves ``L->top`` unchanged - so it will continue to be just past the top of the results list. This is because luaV_execute() does not have a way of informing callers how many values were returned; so the caller can determine the number of results by inspecting ``L->top``.

Examples
--------

Example of '``OP_VARARG``' followed by '``OP_RETURN``'::

  function x(...) return ... end

  1 [1]  VARARG          0 0
  2 [1]  RETURN          0 0

Suppose we call ``x(1,2,3)``; then, observe the setting of ``L->top`` when '``OP_RETURN``' executes::

  (LOADK A=1 Bx=-2)      L->top = 4, ci->top = 4
  (LOADK A=2 Bx=-3)      L->top = 4, ci->top = 4
  (LOADK A=3 Bx=-4)      L->top = 4, ci->top = 4
  (TAILCALL A=0 B=4 C=0) L->top = 4, ci->top = 4
  (VARARG A=0 B=0)       L->top = 2, ci->top = 2  ; we are in x()
  (RETURN A=0 B=0)       L->top = 3, ci->top = 2

Observe that '``OP_VARARG``' set ``L->top`` to ``base+3``.

But if we call ``x(1)`` instead::

  (LOADK A=1 Bx=-2)      L->top = 4, ci->top = 4
  (LOADK A=2 Bx=-3)      L->top = 4, ci->top = 4
  (LOADK A=3 Bx=-4)      L->top = 4, ci->top = 4
  (TAILCALL A=0 B=4 C=0) L->top = 4, ci->top = 4
  (VARARG A=0 B=0)       L->top = 2, ci->top = 2 ; we are in x()
  (RETURN A=0 B=0)       L->top = 1, ci->top = 2

Notice that this time '``OP_VARARG``' set ``L->top`` to ``base+1``.

'``OP_JMP``' instruction
========================

Syntax
------

::

  JMP sBx PC += sBx

Description
-----------

Performs an unconditional jump, with sBx as a signed displacement. sBx is added to the program counter (PC), which points to the next instruction to be executed. 
E.g., if sBx is 0, the VM will proceed to the next instruction.

'``OP_JMP``' is used in loops, conditional statements, and in expressions when a boolean true/false need to be generated.

Examples
--------

For example, since a relational test instruction makes conditional jumps rather than generate a boolean result, a JMP is used in the code sequence for loading either a true or a false::

  function x() local m, n; return m >= n end

Generates::

  function <stdin:1,1> (7 instructions at 00000034D2ABE340)
  0 params, 3 slots, 0 upvalues, 2 locals, 0 constants, 0 functions
    1       [1]     LOADNIL         0 1
    2       [1]     LE              1 1 0   ; to 4 if false    (n <= m)
    3       [1]     JMP             0 1     ; to 5
    4       [1]     LOADBOOL        2 0 1
    5       [1]     LOADBOOL        2 1 0
    6       [1]     RETURN          2 2
    7       [1]     RETURN          0 1
  constants (0) for 00000034D2ABE340:
  locals (2) for 00000034D2ABE340:
    0       m       2       8
    1       n       2       8
  upvalues (0) for 00000034D2ABE340:

Line[2] performs the relational test. In line [3], the JMP skips over the false path (line [4]) to the true path (line [5]). The result is placed into temporary local 2, and returned to the caller by RETURN in line [6].

'``OP_VARARG``' instruction
===========================

Syntax
------

::

  VARARG  A B R(A), R(A+1), ..., R(A+B-1) = vararg

Description
-----------

``VARARG`` implements the vararg operator ``...`` in expressions. ``VARARG`` copies B-1 parameters into a number of registers starting from R(A), padding with nils if there aren’t enough values. If B is 0, ``VARARG`` copies as many values as it can based on the number of parameters passed. If a fixed number of values is required, B is a value greater than 1. If any number of values is required, B is 0.


Examples
--------

The use of VARARG will become clear with the help of a few examples::

  local a,b,c = ...

Generates::

  main <(string):0,0> (2 instructions at 00000029D9FA8310)
  0+ params, 3 slots, 1 upvalue, 3 locals, 0 constants, 0 functions
        1       [1]     VARARG          0 4
        2       [1]     RETURN          0 1
  constants (0) for 00000029D9FA8310:
  locals (3) for 00000029D9FA8310:
        0       a       2       3
        1       b       2       3
        2       c       2       3
  upvalues (1) for 00000029D9FA8310:
        0       _ENV    1       0  

Note that the main or top-level chunk is a vararg function. In this example, the left hand side of the assignment statement needs three values (or objects.) So in instruction [1], the operand B of the ``VARARG`` instruction is (3+1), or 4. ``VARARG`` will copy three values into a, b and c. If there are less than three values available, nils will be used to fill up the empty places.

::

  local a = function(...) local a,b,c = ... end

This gives::

  main <(string):0,0> (2 instructions at 00000029D9FA72D0)
  0+ params, 2 slots, 1 upvalue, 1 local, 0 constants, 1 function
        1       [1]     CLOSURE         0 0     ; 00000029D9FA86D0
        2       [1]     RETURN          0 1
  constants (0) for 00000029D9FA72D0:
  locals (1) for 00000029D9FA72D0:
        0       a       2       3

Here is an alternate version where a function is instantiated and assigned to local a. The old-style arg is retained for compatibility purposes, but is unused in the above example.

  local a; a(...)

Leads to::

When a function is called with ``...`` as the argument, the function will accept a variable number of parameters or arguments. On instruction [3], a ``VARARG`` with a B field of 0 is used. The ``VARARG`` will copy all the parameters passed on to the main chunk to register 2 onwards, so that the ``CALL`` in the next line can utilize them as parameters of function ``a``. The function call is set to accept a multiple number of parameters and returns zero results.

Above are two other cases where ``VARARG`` needs to copy all passed parameters 
over to a set of registers in order for the next operation to proceed. Both the above forms of 
table creation and return accepts a variable number of values or objects.

Relational And logic Instructions
=================================

Relational and logic instructions are used in conjunction with other instructions to implement control 
structures or expressions. Instead of generating boolean results, these instructions conditionally perform 
a jump over the next instruction; the emphasis is on implementing control blocks. Instructions are arranged 
so that there are two paths to follow based on the relational test.

::

  EQ  A B C if ((RK(B) == RK(C)) ~= A) then PC++
  LT  A B C if ((RK(B) <  RK(C)) ~= A) then PC++
  LE  A B C if ((RK(B) <= RK(C)) ~= A) then PC++

Description
-----------

Compares RK(B) and RK(C), which may be registers or constants. If the boolean result is not A, 
then skip the next instruction. Conversely, if the boolean result equals A, continue with the 
next instruction.

``EQ`` is for equality. ``LT`` is for “less than” comparison. ``LE`` is for “less than or equal to” 
comparison. The boolean A field allows the full set of relational comparison operations to be 
synthesized from these three instructions. The Lua code generator produces either 0 or 1 for the boolean A.

For the fall-through case, a ``JMP`` is always expected, in order to optimize execution in the 
virtual machine. In effect, ``EQ``, ``LT`` and ``LE`` must always be paired with a following ``JMP`` 
instruction.

Examples
--------
By comparing the result of the relational operation with A, the sense of the comparison can 
be reversed. Obviously the alternative is to reverse the paths taken by the instruction, but that 
will probably complicate code generation some more. The conditional jump is performed if the comparison 
result is not A, whereas execution continues normally if the comparison result matches A. 
Due to the way code is generated and the way the virtual machine works, a ``JMP`` instruction is 
always expected to follow an ``EQ``, ``LT`` or ``LE``. The following ``JMP`` is optimized by 
executing it in conjunction with ``EQ``, ``LT`` or ``LE``.

  local x,y; return x ~= y

Generates::

  main <(string):0,0> (7 instructions at 0000001BC48FD390)
  0+ params, 3 slots, 1 upvalue, 2 locals, 0 constants, 0 functions
        1       [1]     LOADNIL         0 1
        2       [1]     EQ              0 0 1

        5       [1]     LOADBOOL        2 1 0
        6       [1]     RETURN          2 2
        7       [1]     RETURN          0 1
  constants (0) for 0000001BC48FD390:
  locals (2) for 0000001BC48FD390:
        0       x       2       8

  upvalues (1) for 0000001BC48FD390:
        0       _ENV    1       0

In the above example, the equality test is performed in instruction [2]. However, since the 
comparison need to be returned as a result, ``LOADBOOL`` instructions are used to set a 
register with the correct boolean value. This is the usual code pattern generated if the expression 
requires a boolean value to be generated and stored in a register as an intermediate value or 
a final result.

It is easier to visualize the disassembled code as::

  if x ~= y then
    return true
  else
    return false
  end

The true result path (when the comparison result matches A) goes like this::

  1  [1] LOADNIL    0   1      
  2  [1] EQ         0   0   1    ; to 4 if true    (x ~= y)
  3  [1] JMP        1            ; to 5
  5  [1] LOADBOOL   2   1   0    ; true            (true path)
  6  [1] RETURN     2   2      

While the false result path (when the comparison result does not match A) goes like this::

  1  [1] LOADNIL    0   1      
  2  [1] EQ         0   0   1    ; to 4 if true    (x ~= y)
  4  [1] LOADBOOL   2   0   1    ; false, to 6     (false path)
  6  [1] RETURN     2   2      

Comments following the ``EQ`` in line [2] lets the user know when the conditional jump 
is taken. The jump is taken when “the value in register 0 equals to the value in register 1” 
(the comparison) is not false (the value of operand A). If the comparison is x == y, 
everything will be the same except that the A operand in the ``EQ`` instruction will be 1, 
thus reversing the sense of the comparison. Anyway, these are just the Lua code generator’s 
conventions; there are other ways to code x ~= y in terms of Lua virtual machine instructions.

For conditional statements, there is no need to set boolean results. Lua is optimized for 
coding the more common conditional statements rather than conditional expressions.

::

  local x,y; if x ~= y then return "foo" else return "bar" end

Results in::

  main <(string):0,0> (9 instructions at 0000001BC4914D50)
  0+ params, 3 slots, 1 upvalue, 2 locals, 2 constants, 0 functions

        0       x       2       10

In the above conditional statement, the same inequality operator is used in the source, 
but the sense of the ``EQ`` instruction in line [2] is now reversed. Since the ``EQ`` 
conditional jump can only skip the next instruction, additional ``JMP`` instructions 
are needed to allow large blocks of code to be placed in both true and false paths. 
In contrast, in the previous example, only a single instruction is needed to set a 
boolean value. For ``if`` statements, the true block comes first followed by the false 
block in code generated by the code generator. To reverse the positions of the true and 
false paths, the value of operand A is changed.

The true path (when ``x ~= y`` is true) goes from [2] to [4]–[6] and on to [9]. Since 
there is a ``RETURN`` in line [5], the ``JMP`` in line [6] and the ``RETURN`` in [9] 
are never executed at all; they are redundant but does not adversely affect performance 
in any way. The false path is from [2] to [3] to [7]–[9] onwards. So in a disassembly 
listing, you should see the true and false code blocks in the same order as in the 
Lua source.

The following is another example, this time with an ``elseif``::

  if 8 > 9 then return 8 elseif 5 >= 4 then return 5 else return 9 end

This example is a little more complex, but the blocks are structured in the same order 
as the Lua source, so interpreting the disassembled code should not be too hard.
