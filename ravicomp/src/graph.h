/*
 * Various graph manipulation routines.
 * The graph is designed to manage nodes that are just integer ids.
 * Node ids range from [0..n) - hence one can simply represent nodes as arrays.
 *
 * The graph structure does not care what the node represents and
 * knows nothing about it. The benefit of this approach is that we can make
 * the graph algorithms reusable. There may be some performance cost as we
 * need to map node ids to nodes.
 *
 * The assumption here is that each node corresponds to a basic block in
 * the program intermediate code. And each basic block is identified by a node
 * id which can be used to construct the control flow graph.
