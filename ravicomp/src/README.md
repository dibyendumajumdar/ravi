# Sources

* `lexer.c` - derived from Lua 5.3 lexer but modified to work as a standalone lexer
* `parser.c` - responsible for generating abstract syntax tree (AST) - consumes lexer output
* `ast_printer.c` - responsible for printing out the AST
* `ast_walker.c` - API for walking the AST
* `ast_simplify.c` - responsible for simplifications done on AST such as constant folding
* `ast_lower.c` - AST transformations - converts generic for loop to while loop
* `typechecker.c` - responsible for performing typechecking and assigning types to various things. Runs on the AST
* `linearizer.c` - responsible for generating linear intermediate code (linear IR) from the AST
* `cfg.c` - responsible for constructing a control flow graph from the output of the linearizer
* `dominator.c` - implementation of dominator tree calculation - not used yet

## Utilities

* `allocate.c` - memory allocator
